/**
 * Provides data access objects (DAOs) for interacting with the database.
 * This package contains classes responsible for interacting with
 * the database, including methods for creating, reading, updating,
 * and deleting data.
 * DAOs in this package are designed to abstract away the details
 * of database interactions, making it easier to work with
 * data from different parts of the application.
 * Each DAO is responsible for a specific entity, such as User,
 * ensuring a clear separation of concerns for data access.
